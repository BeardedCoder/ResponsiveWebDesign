#Responsive Web Design

This is responsive web design example for a simple blog layout. The example accompanies a talk I gave at [Conestoga College](http://conestogac.on.ca/) on Responsive Web Design.

##Project Structure

###Round One

This is the initial mobile-first layout. It is designed without media queries instead relying on relative sizing to adapt a simple one-column layout to the device width.

###Round Two

The addition of a sidebar is made in this round. This breaks the mobile adapting layout as the sidebar is always present (corrected in Round Three).

###Round Three

This round introduces media queries to hide the sidebar for sufficiently narrow devices. As well media queries are used to adjust font sizing and spacing in other areas.
