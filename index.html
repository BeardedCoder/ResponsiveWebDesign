							An enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round eyes, and  feebly stretching out one paw, trying to touch her. 'Poor little thing!'  said Alice, in a coaxing tone, and she tried hard to whistle to it; but  she was terribly frightened all the time at the thought that it might be  hungry, in which case it would be very likely to eat her up in spite of  all her coaxing.

						<p>
							Hardly knowing what she did, she picked up a little bit of stick, and  held it out to the puppy; whereupon the puppy jumped into the air off  all its feet at once, with a yelp of delight, and rushed at the stick,  and made believe to worry it; then Alice dodged behind a great thistle,  to keep herself from being run over; and the moment she appeared on the  other side, the puppy made another rush at the stick, and tumbled head  over heels in its hurry to get hold of it; then Alice, thinking it was  very like having a game of play with a cart-horse, and expecting every  moment to be trampled under its feet, ran round the thistle again; then  the puppy began a series of short charges at the stick, running a very  little way forwards each time and a long way back, and barking hoarsely  all the while, till at last it sat down a good way off, panting, with  its tongue hanging out of its mouth, and its great eyes half shut.
						</p>
						<p>
							This seemed to Alice a good opportunity for making her escape; so she  set off at once, and ran till she was quite tired and out of breath, and  till the puppy's bark sounded quite faint in the distance.

							'Well, it's got no business there, at any rate: go and take it away!'
						</p>
						<p>
							There was a long silence after this, and Alice could only hear whispers  now and then; such as, 'Sure, I don't like it, yer honour, at all, at  all!' 'Do as I tell you, you coward!' and at last she spread out her  hand again, and made another snatch in the air. This time there were  TWO little shrieks, and more sounds of broken glass. 'What a number of  cucumber-frames there must be!' thought Alice. 'I wonder what they'll do  next! As for pulling me out of the window, I only wish they COULD! I'm  sure I don't want to stay in here any longer!'
